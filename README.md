# POPVote Open Sources

POPVote is a simple, pragmatic, and secure system for public voting onsite at physical polling
stations and/or offsite online voting.

It is created by the Public Opinion Program (POP) at the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute (HKPORI) for large-scale electronic polling. It is designed for non-government polling as a means to measure and express public opinions in different regimes. In view of its politically-sensitive nature, the system must guarantee strong privacy to the voters.

The current version is designed and developed for onsite voting at physical stations set up for the Primary Election of the Hong Kong Democrats for the 2020 Legislative Council Election, but the system is designed to be useful beyond that and to support voting over the Internet like previous POPVote operation (e.g. the 2012 and 2014 Civil Referendum Projects).

The team is open-sourcing the specification in Apache 2 license. We wish it will provide
transparency to the design, security and trade-off of the system to different stakeholders.

The team plan to open sources and license the software after the Primary Elections have been completed in Jul 2020.
